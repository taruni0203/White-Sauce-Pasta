First, gather your ingredients and start cutting your vegetables.
Cut your carrots into small cubes, your onions into strands, and finely chop the garlic.
In a pan, pour a bit of oil and fry all of your vegetables until the onions are transparent.
Add salt, pepper, and any other seasoning of your choice.
Afterwards, take a fresh pan for the sauce, and add four table spoons of butter.
After the butter has melted, add four table spoons of all purpose flour and mix until the color of the mixture slightly darkens.
Then, slowly add 1 cup of milk. It is important to keep mixing the sauce, or else lumps will form. 
After the sauce is completely mixed without any lumps, add your favorite cheese and slowly fold the mixture until the cheese is melted.
Once your sauce is ready, add the vegetables you fried before, and mix.
Add the red pepper flakes and any other seasoning of your choice.
Now, add the pasta.

The recipe is now ready! Serve hot and enjoy!
